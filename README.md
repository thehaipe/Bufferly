## What is Bufferfly?

**Bufferfly** is a native macOS utility designed to make clipboard management as intuitive as scrolling a volume knob. While macOS Tahoe introduced a basic clipboard, Bufferfly takes it further with the **Spin Dial UI** — a circular, tactile interface that lets you fly through your history with a scroll wheel or trackpad.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🎡 The Spin Dial
Forget long, boring lists. Use your mouse wheel to cycle through copied items. The circular motion keeps your focus centered and your navigation fast.

### ⌨️ Custom Global Hotkeys
Record your own shortcuts to summon Bufferfly instantly. Whether it's the classic `Cmd+Shift+V` or something unique, it's all in your control.

### 📥 Menu Bar Ready
Bufferfly lives exclusively in menu bar. No Dock clutter, no distractions. Just a clean, native-feeling utility.

### 🛡️ Privacy by Design
* **100% Local:** Your data never leaves your machine.
* **Open Source:** Auditable code for your peace of mind.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation
1. Download the latest `.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/thehaipe/Bufferfly/releases) page.
2. Drag `Bufferfly.app` to your `Applications` folder.
3. Open the app and grant **Accessibility** permissions (required for the overlay to appear over other windows).

### Usage
* **Summon:** Press your global hotkey (Default: `Cmd + Shift + V`).
* **Navigate:** Use the **Scroll Wheel**, **Trackpad**, or **Arrow Keys**.
* **Paste:** Press `Enter` or click on the desired item.
* **Dismiss:** Press `Esc` or click outside the dial.
