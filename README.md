🚀 Bufferly v0.1.0-alpha: "The First Spin"
Welcome to the very first public build of Bufferly! This is the beginning of our journey to create the most fluid clipboard experience for macOS. We’ve taken the native capabilities of macOS Tahoe and added speed, inertia, and a whole new way to interact with your history.

What’s New
-Spin Dial UI: Our flagship circular interface is here. Clipboard history is no longer just a static list—it’s a smooth, tactile dial that’s a joy to scroll through.

Privacy First: Bufferly works entirely offline. Your snippets, passwords, and sensitive data never leave your Mac. Period.
Tahoe Ready: Full support for the Liquid Glass design language and macOS 26 system standards.
⚠️ Alpha Status
Bugs: You might encounter occasional crashes when handling very large images in the clipboard.
Settings: Currently, hotkey settings are not available in the Settings menu, but this is expected in future versions!

If you find a bug or have an idea to make the Bufferfly even better — open an issue on GitHub!

PS: Made with ❤️ to the Lviv Polytechnic SE community, thank you for getting me interested in programming :)
